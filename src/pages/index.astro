            <p>I'm a Software Engineer interested in developing mobile applications with React Native and cloud infastructure.</p>
            <p>This past summer I interned at a YapRap LLC where I developed a website and mobile application, and deployed the mobile app to the App Store and Google Play.</p>
            <p>Currently I'm studying at the University of Minnesota, wrapping up my degree in Mathematics - Computer-Application.</p>
            <p>Outside of class you can find me playing soccer, ultimate frisbee, and working on mobile apps for cool ideas that randomly come up in the shower, which I take every day.</p>
