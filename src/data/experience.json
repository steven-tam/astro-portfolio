On the frontend, I designed and developed the navbar, footer, bar chart, and checklist. On the backend, I used Node and Express to create endpoints for delivering data of each major stored as JSONB in Postgres. I used Python to pull and preprocess data from UMN's program API, which contains over 1000 programs, including certificates, undergraduate programs, and graduate programs across all University of Minnesota locations (Twin Cities, Duluth, Crookston, and Rochester).",
